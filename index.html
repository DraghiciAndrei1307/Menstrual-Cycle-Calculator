          <h2>Menstrual Cycle Overview</h2>
          <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural, recurring process in a woman's body, marking her reproductive health and fertility. Each cycle typically begins on the first day of menstruation (bleeding) and lasts until the first day of the next menstrual period. While the average cycle is about 28 days, it can vary between 21 to 35 days, depending on individual factors.</p>
          <p>Understanding your menstrual cycle is essential, not just for reproductive planning, but also for monitoring overall health and recognizing potential hormonal imbalances. Below is a detailed guide to the menstrual cycle, its phases, and the factors that influence it.</p>  
        </div>    
      </div>
      <div class="phases info-section">
        <div class = "info-section-text">
          <h2>Phases of the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
          <p>The menstrual cycle is divided into four main phases, each serving a unique role in preparing the body for potential pregnancy.</p>
          <h3>1. Menstrual Phase</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Duration: Typically lasts between 3 to 7 days.</li>
            <li>What Happens: This phase begins on the first day of menstruation. During this time, the lining of the uterus, which thickened in preparation for a potential pregnancy, is shed through the vagina. Bleeding occurs as a result of this shedding.</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Common symptoms include cramping (due to the contraction of the uterus), fatigue, bloating, and mood changes.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>2. Folicular Phase</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Duration: Starts on the first day of your period and continues until ovulation (usually day 1 to day 14 in a 28-day cycle).</li>
            <li>What Happens: The pituitary gland releases Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovaries to produce follicles. Each follicle contains an immature egg. Typically, only one follicle will mature into a fully developed egg. During this phase, estrogen levels rise, causing the uterine lining to thicken in preparation for possible fertilization.</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Increased energy levels, clearer skin, and a general feeling of well-being.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>3. Ovulation Phase</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Duration: Ovulation occurs approximately mid-cycle (around day 14 in a typical 28-day cycle).</li>
            <li>What Happens: A surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) triggers the release of a mature egg from the ovary. This is the point in the cycle when you are most fertile. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, where it can potentially be fertilized by sperm.</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Mild cramping, increased cervical mucus (clear and stretchy like egg whites), and a slight rise in basal body temperature.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>4. Luteal Phase</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Duration: Lasts from ovulation to the start of the next period (approximately days 15-28).</li>
            <li>What Happens: After the egg is released, the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Progesterone helps maintain the thickened uterine lining. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down, leading to a drop in progesterone and triggering menstruation.</li>
            <li>Symptoms: Premenstrual symptoms (PMS) such as bloating, mood swings, breast tenderness, and fatigue.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How the Menstrual Cycle Calculator Works</h2>
          <p>A menstrual cycle calculator helps predict the dates of your next period, as well as your most fertile days. By entering basic information such as the start date of your last period and the typical length of your cycle, the calculator can estimate the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Next period start date: Based on your cycle length, the calculator predicts when your next period will begin.</li>
            <li>Ovulation date: Using the cycle data, it calculates when ovulation is likely to occur (usually around the midpoint of the cycle).</li>
            <li>Fertile window: The calculator identifies the fertile window—typically the 5 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself, when you are most likely to conceive.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="window info-section">
          <div class = "info-section-text">
            <h2>Fertile Window and Ovulation</h2>
            <p>The fertile window is the period during your menstrual cycle when pregnancy is most likely to occur. </p>
            <p>This window includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The 5 days leading up to ovulation and</li>
              <li>The day of ovulation itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days, so having intercourse during this period increases the likelihood of fertilization. Ovulation usually occurs around day 14 in a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on cycle length and regularity.</p>
            <p>Signs of Ovulation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clear, stretchy cervical mucus.</li>
              <li>Mild pelvic or abdominal discomfort (often called “mittelschmerz”).</li>
              <li>A slight increase in basal body temperature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tracking your ovulation and fertile window is essential for anyone looking to conceive or avoid pregnancy naturally.</p>

          <h2>Factors Affecting the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
          <p>Several internal and external factors can influence the length, regularity, and symptoms of your menstrual cycle. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stress: High stress levels can disrupt hormonal balance and delay ovulation, resulting in an irregular or missed period.</li>
            <li>Diet and Exercise: Extreme dieting or excessive exercise can lower body fat, which may lead to menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).</li>
            <li>Hormonal Imbalances: Conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders can lead to irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, or missed periods.</li>
            <li>Contraceptive Use: Hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, IUDs, or patches) can alter your cycle, making it more predictable, or in some cases, halting menstruation altogether.</li>
            <li>Medical Conditions: Disorders such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or chronic diseases can affect the menstrual cycle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding how these factors interact with your body can help you make informed decisions about your reproductive and overall health.</p>

          <h2>Common Symptoms and Cycle Variations</h2>
          <p>While many women experience a consistent pattern, variations in the menstrual cycle are normal. Here are some common cycle symptoms and what they may indicate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Heavy Periods (Menorrhagia): Excessive bleeding, lasting more than 7 days, may be a sign of underlying conditions such as fibroids or hormone imbalances.</li>
            <li>Painful Periods (Dysmenorrhea): Severe cramps or discomfort during menstruation can indicate endometriosis or uterine fibroids.</li>
            <li>Irregular Periods: Fluctuating cycle lengths may be caused by stress, weight changes, or hormonal disorders like PCOS.</li>
            <li>Absence of Periods (Amenorrhea): Missing periods for three or more months could be related to pregnancy, extreme weight loss, or endocrine issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you experience severe or persistent symptoms, it’s recommended to consult a healthcare provider.</p>

          <h2>Contraception and the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
          <p>Hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills, patches, or IUDs can influence the menstrual cycle by regulating, lightening, or even stopping periods. It's important to understand how these methods work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Birth Control Pills: Can create more regular periods by controlling hormone levels.</li>
            <li>IUD (Intrauterine Device): Hormonal IUDs may lighten periods or stop them altogether, while non-hormonal IUDs may make periods heavier.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consult with your healthcare provider to determine which contraceptive method is best suited for your lifestyle and health goals.</p>
