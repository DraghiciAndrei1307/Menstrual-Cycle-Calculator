      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h2>Menstrual Cycle Overview</h2>
        <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural, recurring process in a woman's body, marking her reproductive health and fertility. Each cycle typically begins on the first day of menstruation (bleeding) and lasts until the first day of the next menstrual period. While the average cycle is about 28 days, it can vary between 21 to 35 days, depending on individual factors.</p>
        <p>Understanding your menstrual cycle is essential, not just for reproductive planning, but also for monitoring overall health and recognizing potential hormonal imbalances. Below is a detailed guide to the menstrual cycle, its phases, and the factors that influence it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="phases">
        <h2>Phases of the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
        <p>The menstrual cycle is divided into four main phases, each serving a unique role in preparing the body for potential pregnancy.</p>
        <h3>1. Menstrual Phase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Duration</li>
          <li>What Happens</li>
          <li>Symptoms</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Folicular Phase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Duration</li>
          <li>What Happens</li>
          <li>Symptoms</li>

          <li>Duration</li>
          <li>What Happens</li>
          <li>Symptoms</li>

        <h3>How the Menstrual Cycle Calculator Works</h3>
        <p>A menstrual cycle calculator helps predict the dates of your next period, as well as your most fertile days. By entering basic information such as the start date of your last period and the typical length of your cycle, the calculator can estimate the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Next period start date</li>
          <li>Ovulation date</li>
          <li>Fertile window</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
